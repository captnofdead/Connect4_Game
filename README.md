# Connect4_Game

Welcome to the Connect4 game agents repository!
This repository contains two implementations of game agents for the popular game Connect4. The agents use two reinforcement learning algorithms: Monte Carlo tree search and Q learning.
To use the agents, you will need to have a working installation of the Connect4 game. The agents can then be integrated into the game to play against each other or human players.
The Monte Carlo tree search agent uses a tree-based search algorithm to explore the game's decision space and select the best moves. The Q learning agent uses a neural network to approximate the Q function and learn from experience.
To train the Q learning agent, you will need to provide it with a dataset of past game states and corresponding actions. The agent will use this data to learn the optimal policy for playing Connect4.
Overall, these agents provide a fun and exciting way to explore the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of a popular game.
