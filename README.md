# Connect4_Game

Welcome to the Connect4 game agents repository!
This repository contains two implementations of game agents for the popular game Connect4. <br \>
The agents use two reinforcement learning algorithms: Monte Carlo tree search and Q learning.
To use the agents, you will need to download the all the files and run them, you will have to install pre-requiste libraies for the same. <br /> <br />
Pre-requisites:

````
Python 3.6+
NumPy
GZip 
Pickle
PyGame
````
The **Monte Carlo tree** search agent uses a tree-based search algorithm to explore the game's decision space and select the best moves. <br /> <br />
The **Q learning agent** approximate the Q function and learn from experience. <br /> <br />
To train the ***Q learning agent***, you can play it against the MCTS agent, and the values are stored in QTable. The agent will use this data to learn the optimal policy for playing Connect4. <br /> <br />
Overall, these agents provide a fun and exciting way to explore the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms in the context of a popular game.
